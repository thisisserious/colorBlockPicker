# jQuery Color Block Picker
This game prompts the user to pick a color. If they pick the correct color, they receive a success! message. If they pick the incorrect color, they are prompted to try again.

### To Do
- Get 'try again' message to correctly display by replacing the original instruction message
- Prompt the player to pick another block randomly and let them keep playing
- Make it easy to add or remove color blocks using an array
- Add timeout function
